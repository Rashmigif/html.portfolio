<h1>The Best Movies According to Rashmi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>Watching Friends is like being with them such a joyful one</p>
<h3>Game of Throne</h3>
<p>They should have named as Goosebumps throne cause it has n-number of scenes like that</p>
<h3>Dark</h3>
<p>Dark is like you have to be cautious cause if you miss a scene you can't understand that. Such a great plot</p>
